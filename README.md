## The Problem
Standard AI coding assistants suffer from:
* **Context Amnesia:** Loss of architectural decisions across sessions.
* **Failure Loops:** Repeatedly attempting previously discarded solutions.
* **Code Bloat:** Skipping safety and design checks for rapid generation.

# N3-Protocol & Persistent Memory Layer

A template repository providing a deterministic first-principles workflow and a persistent Markdown memory layer for AI coding assistants.

## Overview

AI coding assistants frequently suffer from context amnesia between sessions, lack structured architectural review processes, and accumulate technical debt. This repository establishes a framework to solve these issues using two mechanisms:

1. **The N3 Protocol:** A strict 4-phase engineering workflow (Understand, Diagnose, Design, Execute) with mandatory verifiable deliverables.
2. **Persistent Document Cache:** A structured folder tree of Markdown files acting as the assistant's long-term memory (logs, decisions, penalties, and procedural guides) entirely decoupled from source code execution.

 **Overview:** A deterministic first-principles engineering workflow and structured local memory layer for AI coding assistants. Designed to eliminate context amnesia, enforce rigorous debugging, and maintain a zero-bloat codebase.

                                     **arquitectura planteada**


## 1. First-Principles Protocol (N3)

Execute strictly in order. Each phase must produce a verifiable deliverable; if it cannot be produced, declare a block and halt execution immediately (no filling or guessing).

### Phase A — Understand (No Code Modification)
* **A15.1 Declare Objective:**
  * **Deliverable:** A chain of $\le 5$ steps structured as: `action → effect → final state`.
* **A13 Recursive Deconstruction:**
  * Ask *HOW* and *WHY* iteratively down to a verifiable fact (code, data, or physical limit).
  * **Deliverable:** Tree of max 3 levels. Each leaf = evidence `file:line`.
* **A01 Infeasibility Discard:**
  * List what CANNOT work due to hard language, syntax, architecture, or platform limits; persist in memory to prevent failure loops.
* **A03 Bounding Box:**
  * **Deliverable:** Active, updatable view (tree/cascade format) of involved files, API routes, data flows, database schemas, and objectives.
* **A02 Execution Map:**
  * **Deliverable:** Mermaid sequence diagram (`sequenceDiagram`) comparing current vs. proposed flow, highlighting architecture bottlenecks or vulnerabilities.

### Phase B — Diagnose
* **A08 Forensic Autopsy:**
  * Identify root cause before proposing fixes (consulting A01, A02, A03).
  * **Deliverable:** `symptom → immediate cause → root cause → why tests missed it`.
* **A07 Flags & Care Zones:**
  * Mark bounding box areas touching: Core Engine, Database, Access Control, Vulnerabilities, or Target Flow.
* **A10 Security Checklist (Fail-Closed):**
  * Audit endpoints/flows against unauthorized access. Examples: Authentication (`validateApiSession`, `apiAuth`), tenant/role authorization, fail-closed validation, and peer-reviewed patterns.
* **A12 Scaling & Technical Debt:**
  * Plan architectural studies using A03 to reduce technical debt at a senior engineering level.

### Phase C — Design
* **A06 Prior Art & Consultation:**
  1. Grep repository for similar implementations.
  2. Check external references (official docs, mature open-source repos).
  * **Deliverable:** `source + what is reused + known failure avoided`.
* **A05 Algorithmic Core:**
  * Identify core algorithms/equations, their $O(\cdot)$ complexity, edge cases, and calculation stability.
* **A14 What-If Mutations:**
  * *Only after A13 + A08.* Propose 1–2 mutations indicating: what changes, why it's better, previous failure avoided, and cost.
* **A15.2 Synchronicity & Dependencies:**
  * Map interactions across scripts, APIs, dependencies, modules, and tests to prevent unintended side effects during scaling.
* **A09 Smoke-Free Plan:**
  * **Deliverable:** Numbered steps focused strictly on real project goals without hallucination.
  * **Rule:** Await explicit user sign-off before proceeding.

### Phase D — Execute & Test
* Create a Git checkpoint/commit prior to modifications.
* **A11 Senior-Grade Testing (Vitest / Playwright):**
  For every critical flow touched, validate:
  1. Happy path.
  2. Flow, architecture, or build failure.
  3. Invalid input handling.
  4. System operational idempotency.

## 2. Elite Engineering Paradigms

* **Anthropic Effective Agents:** Prioritize workflows over complex agents. Use Evaluator-Optimizer loops and structured diffs.
* **Aider (Paul Gauthier):** Repository Map with AST + PageRank for dependency compression, and Git-as-Checkpoints with auto-rollback.
* **DAIR.AI (Elvis Saravia):** Tree-of-Thoughts and ReAct with strict alternation: `Thought → Action → Observation`.
* **Andrej Karpathy (nanoGPT & LLM OS):** Treat LLM as a CPU; maintain a Zero-Bloat loop and continuous quantitative evals before touching code.
* **Microsoft / Patrick Guso (Agents from Scratch):** Layered memory harness (volatile RAM vs. SHA-256 immutable vault) and security circuit breakers.

## 3. Persistent Memory & Document Cache Structure

The repository maintains an external Markdown-based document cache so the assistant retains context across sessions without bloating source code:

* `manifesto/`: Core principles, axioms, and master rules.
* `learning/`: Technical growth blocks (confidence metrics, logic penalties, validated rewards, uncertainty zones).
* `legacy/`: Historical versions or discarded approaches.
* `diaries/`: Session logs.
* `discoveries/`: Innovative snippets and technical findings.
* `lessons/`: Bug resolution learnings.
* `theories/`: Architecture hypotheses to test.
* `logs/`: Structured logs (decisions/ADRs, discoveries, failures/autopsies, simulations).
* `memory/`: Structured agent memory (causal, episodic, identity, long-term, procedural, short-term, procedures, trash, vault).

### Autonomous Management Rules for the Assistant
1. **Asynchronous Logging:** Upon resolving complex tasks, record execution summaries in `logs/decisions/` or `diaries/` (`Problem → Root Cause → Solution`).
2. **Skill Updates:** When discovering reusable patterns, update or create Markdown files under `learning/rewards/` or `memory/procedural/`.
3. **Failure Tracking:** If an approach fails, log the evidence in `learning/penalties/` and `logs/failures/` to prevent recurrence.
4. **Zero Code Pollution:** Markdown files act exclusively as external disk memory and never interfere with software compilation or runtime execution.
